# Netflix_Movie_recommendation_System

In my recent project focusing on movie recommendation system development, I followed a systematic approach to ensure accuracy and user engagement:
Dataset & Jupyter Notebook Setup: I meticulously sourced and preprocessed the movie dataset, ensuring it was clean and suitable for analysis. Leveraging Jupyter Notebooks, I streamlined the development process for optimal efficiency.

Data Preprocessing: This crucial phase involved thorough cleaning and organization of the movie dataset. I handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and prepared the data for subsequent analysis, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

Vectorization: Employing techniques like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer, I transformed textual movie data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. This step was vital for converting raw text data into a format understandable by algorithms.

Main Function: I developed the core functionality of the recommendation system, implementing algorithms such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering. These algorithms enabled the system to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

Frontend/Streamlit: To enhance accessibility and user-friendliness, I designed a frontend interface using Streamlit. This interface allowed users to interact with the system seamlessly, providing inputs such as movie preferences and receiving personalized recommendations in return. Additionally, I incorporated features to display movie posters and titles along with the recommendations, enriching the user experience.
